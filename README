jQuery.eraser
jQuery plugin that makes an image erasable (with mouse or touch movements)

this plugin replaces the targeted image by an interactive canvas that can be erased
using touch ou mouse moves.



Check this :

This plug-in only works with images. 
The image must be loaded in the page because the eraser makes a copy of its data into a canvas.
jQuery's ready and load events are not secure for calling eraser().
In my testing, I have found that a simple <body onload="init();"> makes the trick.




Usage :


To transform an image into an erasable canvas, just use this syntax :

	$('#yourImage').eraser();


You can reset the canvas (back to the original image) with this code :

	$('#yourImage').eraser('reset');


And you can erase all the canvas' content by calling :

	$('#yourImage').eraser('clear');
