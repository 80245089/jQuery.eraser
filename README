jQuery.erase
jQuery plugin that makes an image erasable (with mouse or touch movements)

this plugins replaces the targeted image by an interactive canvas.


KNOWN BUGS :

- there's a big problem with the onload event with images in most browsers,
so i have to find a solution to make the eraser start correctly anytime

- Firefox is not my friend today.

- positions go wrong if you resize your window. (should be easy to fix)
